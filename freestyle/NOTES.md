Freestyle Pages
===============

Freestyle pages should allow a user to build a page from components that will
serve as building blocks. These blocks will include:

* A full-page image carousel that can serve as the welcome splash of the home
  page. This should include an optional big title and sub-titles and blurbs for
  each picture in the carousel.

* A way to display several columns worth of images with links (e.g., for funder
  images on the home page). Should these be dynamically packed?

* A feature list of article-like pages, which should be responsible for
  rendering themselves in feature lists.

* Columns of text, each with an optional title.
